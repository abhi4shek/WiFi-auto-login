# WiFi-auto-login
Introducing the new & improved version of my College WiFi Auto-Login portal:

->Desktop-first UI with a sleek, minimal design.

->Better session handling with a cleaner keep-alive logic.

->Local credential storage with auto-reconnect.

->Built entirely in vanilla HTML + JS, no libraries needed.

Just plug in your credentials, and it keeps you online — no more interruptions!

I created this with real-world student pain in mind: flaky campus WiFi, login loops, and time wasted.
Built with ☕, patience, and lots of trial-and-error.


1.Simply pull/download Wi-Fi_Autologin-1.html and open wifi and connect to collage wifi and as it shows Action required to login to wifi.

2.Just open/run the file Wi-Fi_Autologin-1.html and fill credential and connect.

3.Next time when you want to connect to wifi just open/run Wi-Fi_Autologin-1.html it will handle all things by it's own.
