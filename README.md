# WiFi-auto-login
Introducing the new & improved version of my College WiFi Auto-Login project:

->Desktop-first UI with a sleek, minimal design.

->Better session handling with a cleaner keep-alive logic.

->Local credential storage with auto-reconnect.

->Built entirely in vanilla HTML + JS, no libraries needed.

Just plug in your credentials, and it keeps you online — no more interruptions!

I created this with real-world student pain in mind: flaky campus WiFi, login loops, and time wasted.
Built with ☕, patience, and lots of trial-and-error.
